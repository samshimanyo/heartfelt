                        <h3><i>Let Me Intoduce Them~</i></h3>
                        <p>Let me start with the <em>youngest</em> of us three, the one and only, <a href="diva.html" class="linkf">Diva</a>! She's like that one ice cream flavour that you just can't live without...she's got it all! from the biggest heart to being the tiniest. She's going to make you feel <em>included</em> and <em>heard</em>, those are the two most important things in a good and healthy relationship with friends/partner/family that most people take for granted these days which is both frustrating and sad. But! this DIVA right here is just so cute and knowledgable...makes you wanna kidnap her and give her the warmest hug &#x2661; (<em>Alert</em>: risky after 9 p.m.)</p>
                        <p>Kidnapping reminds me of.....our second youngest trio member, the one who dreams of getting an <em>omni-van</em> and doing <em>unspeakable</em> things, driving it 'round the town, <a href="minmin.html" class="linkf">Minisha</a>~ She's the kind of person who's gonna have a hard time opening up to people but if you invest time into making the bond stronger, which btw goes both ways, she's going to be one of the <em>sweetest</em> existances you will get to know. She bottles her feelings up quite a lot and often diverts that anxiety into cutting her hair....but i love her anyway....makes me want to treat her to peach iced-teas ever so often (she ain't ever gonna decline that offer lol (cuz who would!?))</p>
                        <p>I know you've realised by now that I've been writing evrything that comes to my mind after thinking of these two hoomans lol, no editing, just a heartfelt description...If you did not catch on, yet, by the way I've been narrating the whole thing, let me draw attention to the fact that I'm the <em>oldest</em> of 'em all.....shi- I'm old-</p>
